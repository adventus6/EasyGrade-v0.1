rightAnswer:
The period from 1793 to 1794 was referred to as the ‘Reign of Terror’ because of the following reasons:

Maximilian Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and punishment. Any person who did not agree with his policies was guillotined.
Robespierre’s government issued laws placing a maximum ceiling on wages and prices. Peasants were forced to sell their grains at prices fixed by the government.
Equality was also sought to be practised through forms of speech and address. Robespierre followed his policies so obstinately that he began to loose support of the people.

studentAnswer: 
The period of 1793-1794 was known as the reign of terror because in this period, after the french revolution the french society was mainly ruled by The Jacobins club and the leader of this club was Maximilan Robespierre who followed strict and harsh methods.
Ex-nobles, Ex-Clergys, members of other political parties and people who did not agree with him, were arrested and sometimes even sent to the Guillotine without trial.
During this period, he made the decision to ration Bread and Meat, and also he forced peasants to grow crops and made them carry it to the city and sell it in a price fixed by the government, all against their wish.
At the time equality was practised through forms of speech.
He also killed a lot of people using the Guillotine without trial and just according to his wish.
In this period, France was filled with his cruel and harsh methods.
He also shut down churches and buildings and converted them into barracks or offices.
This is why the period of 1793-1794 was known as the reign of terror.
